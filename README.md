# Background
Based on the average product cost (USD 210), we assume this dataset represents a furnishing company. This helps in drawing parallels with competitors like IKEA, particularly targeting the Indonesian market. To provide context, we benchmarked the shipping costs and currency conversion against Indonesian standards.

## Shipping Costs:

- Flight: IDR 36,190 (Lion Parcel, Boss Pack, 1-2 days)
- Road: IDR 31,000 (JNT, EZ package, 3-7 days)
- Ship: IDR 4,500 (PELNI, 8-10 days)

## Currency Conversion:

- 1 USD = 16,305 IDR

With around 60% of shipments being delayed, there is a clear need for the company to address these issues to stay competitive in the Indonesian furnishing market.

## Key Questions:
1. What factors influence customer satisfaction, and how can strategies enhance it?
2. What causes shipment delays, and how can delivery timeliness improve?
3. How can shipment operational costs be minimized?

## Analysis Objectives
This report focuses on three main objectives:

1. Increasing profitability through better understanding of customer satisfaction.
2. Identifying and solving the causes of shipment delays for faster delivery.
3. Reducing operational costs by reviewing shipment expenses.

This analysis aims to provide comprehensive insights and actionable strategies to improve business operations in the online retail shipping sector.
